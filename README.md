# 💤 Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis
📌 Overview

This project explores the relationship between lifestyle factors and sleep quality using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset.
It focuses on understanding how stress, physical activity, occupation, and age influence an individual's sleep duration and overall health.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the effect of stress, activity level, and BMI on sleep duration.

Study correlations between different health parameters such as heart rate, age, and daily steps.

Identify lifestyle patterns that contribute to better or poorer sleep quality.

Visualize relationships and distributions through meaningful charts and heatmaps.

# 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes various physiological and lifestyle-related features:

Column	Description
Person ID	Unique identifier for each individual
Gender	Male or Female
Age	Age of the individual
Occupation	Type of job or profession
Sleep Duration	Average hours of sleep per day
Quality of Sleep	Sleep quality rating on a scale of 1 to 10
Physical Activity Level	Daily activity score
Stress Level	Self-reported stress level (1–10)
BMI Category	Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese
Blood Pressure	Systolic/Diastolic measurement
Heart Rate	Average beats per minute
Daily Steps	Average number of steps per day
Sleep Disorder	Type of sleep disorder, if any (None, Insomnia, Apnea)
# ⚙️ Analysis Summary

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and detect missing values.

Examined relationships between sleep duration, stress, and physical activity.

Created correlation heatmaps to identify strongly related variables.

Visualized sleep disorder patterns across different occupations and age groups.

Generated summary statistics to compare the influence of gender, BMI, and lifestyle factors on sleep quality.

# 📊 Key Insights

Individuals with high stress levels generally experience shorter sleep duration.

Physical activity has a positive impact on sleep quality.

Occupation type affects sleep pattern — students and healthcare workers often have irregular or insufficient sleep.

Heart rate and BMI category show a noticeable link with stress and sleep disorders.

The heatmap revealed strong negative correlations between stress and sleep duration.

# 🧠 Tools and Technologies

Python for data analysis

Pandas for data handling

NumPy for numerical calculations

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

# 🚀 Results and Conclusion

The analysis highlights that balanced physical activity, reduced stress, and maintaining a healthy BMI contribute to better sleep quality.
By understanding these correlations, this study emphasizes the importance of lifestyle choices in improving sleep health and overall well-being.

# 🌟 Future Enhancements

Build a predictive model to estimate sleep quality or detect sleep disorders.

Develop an interactive dashboard for visual analysis of individual health metrics.

Integrate additional parameters such as diet, caffeine intake, and screen time for deeper insights.
